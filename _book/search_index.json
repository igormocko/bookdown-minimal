The logic of hypothesis testing is as follows: 1) Identify a population of interest, a parameter of interest, and a question you have about that parameter 2) Make an assumption about the population 3) Examine a random sample from the population to see if it contradicts the assumption you made in Step 2 4) If the sample contradicts the assumption, then reject the assumption. Otherwise, fail to reject the assumption. (NOTE: you can never prove that the assumption is true in a hypothesis test – you can only prove that it is wrong. Hence: “Reject,” or “Fail to Reject”) 5) Answer the original question. Bye. "],
