# Hello World

Hi.

Hypothesis Testing: The Process

A hypothesis test occurs in stages. 

The logic of hypothesis testing is as follows:
1)	Identify a population of interest, a parameter of interest, and a question you have about that parameter
2)	Make an assumption about the population 
3)	Examine a random sample from the population to see if it contradicts the assumption you made in Step 2
4)	If the sample contradicts the assumption, then reject the assumption. Otherwise, fail to reject the assumption. (NOTE: you can never prove that the assumption is true in a hypothesis test – you can only prove that it is wrong. Hence: “Reject,” or “Fail to Reject”)
5)	Answer the original question.


Bye.
